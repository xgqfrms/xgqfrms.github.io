Bash is the GNU Project's shell.  
Bash is the Bourne Again SHell.  
Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).  
It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard.  
It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use.  
In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.

## The improvements offered by Bash include:

+ Command line editing
+ Unlimited size command history
+ Job Control
+ Shell Functions and Aliases
+ Indexed arrays of unlimited size
+ Integer arithmetic in any base from two to sixty-four
